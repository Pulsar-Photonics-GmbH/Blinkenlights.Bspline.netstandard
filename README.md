This library is a conversion of the [Blinkenlights.Bspline package](https://bitbucket.org/pgrebenc/b-spline) from net4.6 to netstandard1.0 to enable multi-plattform usage.
[Blinkenlights.Bspline package](https://bitbucket.org/pgrebenc/b-spline) is based on the JavaScript b-spline code originally published at https://github.com/thibauts/b-spline.
